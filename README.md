Investigating whether the Kingman coalescent can be rejected in favor of multiple mergers
    using genomic diversity data.

##TODO:
    - Set up conda environment(s)
    - Convert old bash scripts to Snakemake
    - Redo data processing for:
        - DPGP3
        - EVE sequences
    - Determine rules for including/excluding windows from analysis
    - Calculate SFS covariance matrices
    - Find good plots/summary statistics of the cov matrices
    - Re-run simulations with more thorough exploration of parameters
    - Revisit quality control at the SNP level
